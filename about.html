      <h3>About Tesla</h3>
      <h4>Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</h4>
      <p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need
        to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to
        drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely
        scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops
        relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain.
        From there, Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S
        – which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and
        efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest
        range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record
        0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product
        line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star
        safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And to
        complete CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, Tesla announced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume
        electric vehicle that began production in 2017.</p>
      <p>Tesla’s vehicles are produced at its Fremont factory in California, where the vast majority of the
        vehicle’s components are also made. As Tesla continues to expand its product line, Tesla’s production plan
        is also set to increase to a rate of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018.</p>
      <p>To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also designed a unique set of energy solutions,
        Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable
        energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Tesla’s automotive and energy products is the
        Gigafactory – a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs and, by 2018, produce more
        lithium-ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By bringing cell production in-house,
        Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of
        jobs.</p>
      <p>And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make
        products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean
        transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage
        already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.</p>
